# MediatR.Extensions.Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc
MediatR.Extensions.Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc is the extension that marries MediatR to ASP.NET Core in a way that keeps MediatR totally agnostic of how it is being used.

Easily configurable, it wraps each MediatR request/handler in a constructed generic controller and provides several flexibility points.

See [Wiki](https://github.com/Artem-Romanenia/MediatR.Extensions.Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc/wiki) to get started.
